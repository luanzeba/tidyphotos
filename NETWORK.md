# TidyPhotos Network Access Guide

## ‚úÖ Local Network Access (Current Setup)

TidyPhotos is now configured to be accessible from other devices on your local network.

### Starting the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will show:
```
TidyPhotos server listening on:
  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:8080
  Network: http://192.168.1.201:8080 (accessible from other devices)
```

### Access URLs

**From this computer:**
- http://127.0.0.1:8080
- http://localhost:8080

**From other devices on your network:**
- **iPhone/iPad:** http://192.168.1.201:8080
- **Other computers:** http://192.168.1.201:8080
- **Android phones:** http://192.168.1.201:8080

### Testing Network Access

1. **Start TidyPhotos** on your main computer: `npm run dev`
2. **Find your phone's browser** and navigate to: `http://192.168.1.201:8080`
3. **Test functionality:**
   - Photo viewing should work
   - Favorite toggle ('f' key or heart icon)
   - Timeline filtering
   - Search functionality

### Troubleshooting

**Can't connect from other devices?**
- Check that both devices are on the same WiFi network
- Try disabling firewall temporarily to test
- Verify the IP address: `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1`

**IP address changed?**
- Your router may assign different IPs. Update the code in `src/main.zig` line 42

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** TidyPhotos currently has no authentication. For remote access:

1. **Add authentication** before exposing to internet
2. **Use HTTPS** for secure connections
3. **Consider VPN** for safest remote access
4. **Firewall rules** to restrict access

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test local network access from your phone
2. Choose remote access method based on your needs
3. Implement authentication if going remote
4. Set up chosen remote access solution
